# Code Refactor Starter Code

Week 1 Challenge guidelines:
User Story:
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Dev Changes:
*Organized CSS Styles and annotated changes throughout HTML and CSS. 
*Changed title to "Horiseon Social Solutions".
*Footer was not incorporated in mockup, centered it at the bottom of the page, following font size and style of the rest of the page.
*Added "alt" text for all images on index file, with the exception of the "jumbotron" hero image. Since background image is not tied directly to text and is aesthetic, it is not delineated with a tag.
